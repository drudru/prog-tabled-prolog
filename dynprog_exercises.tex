\begin{enumerate}
\item
Given two sequences A and B, what is the minimal number of operations
to turn A into B?  The allowable operations are: insert a new symbol,
delete a symbol, and replace a symbol.  Each operation costs one unit.

Hint: Represent string A as facts a(N,Sym), meaning that the symbol at 
position N in string A is Sym.  Similarly for B.  Then write a
predicate cost(N,M,C) which is true if the minimum cost of turning
a1...aN into b1...bM is C.
\end{enumerate}
