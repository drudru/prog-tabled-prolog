\chapter{Table Builtins}

table builtins: get\_calls, get\_returns, abolish\_all\_tables, ...

trie\_assert, trie\_retract (or maybe in section on large files, or
maybe in a separate chapter on indexing.)

Do example to extract parses from a table created by recognition of a
string in a CF grammar.  (How to do, maybe interpreter.)

As examples, how about suspend / resume (which Rui has working at least
partly) and the cursors / server example?
