\chapter{Prolog Programs as Inductive Definitions}

\section{Introduction}
The evaluation of pure Prolog programs is usually formalized as SLD
resolution applied to first-order Horn clauses.  This is how we
descibed it in our chapter on First Order Logic.  However, there ia
another, perhaps more basic and fundamental way to understand logic
programs as providing {\em Inductive Definitions} of sets of tersm.
In this formulation, the first order logic of Horn clauses is just one
particular interpretation of such inductively defined sets of terms.

This chapter is a slight diversion to explore this alternative way to
understand (and formalize) logic programs.
